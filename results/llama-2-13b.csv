In that action you falsely and corruptly swore to facts which were intended to lead the jury to believe you did not steal the jewels. I do not know what would have been the result had it not been for the interposition of one man, who was able to produce a document with your endorsement. But I am sure of one thing. If your wilful and corrupt perjury had succeeded, your friends Major and Mrs. Hargreaves would have left that court with the stain of indelible ignominy upon them. Fortunately it did not succeed. This is a serious matter. The maximum penalty for perjury is seven years' penal servitude. I am not going to inflict that, but I do intend to give a severe punishment for one in your position. I know the jewels and the misappropriated money have been returned, and all the costs paid, and I bear that in mind. You have been some time in prison; you surrendered yourself to justice; your condition is known to me; and Mrs. Hargreaves, as well as your counsel, have appealed for mercy. The sentence is that you be imprisoned for nine months and put to such hard labour as the state of your health will permit.""",0.001466275659824,96.29629629629628
